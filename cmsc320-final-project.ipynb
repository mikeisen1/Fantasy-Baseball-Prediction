    "As the National Pastime, baseball has remained a staple of American culture ever since the 1840s. As the years have progressed and technology has advanced, baseball found itself as the early and current center of statistics in sports. This emergence as the leader of the statistical revolution slowly began in 1913, with the establishment of the record keeping company, <a href=\"http://www.esb.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">Elias Sports Bureau</a>, and in 1947 with the hire of <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Allan_Roth\" target=\"_blank\">Allan Roth</a> by the then Brooklyn Dodgers (who later moved to their current home in Los Angeles). While the Elias Sports Bureau and Roth were invaluable in promoting the use of statistics in the sport, baseball starting using traditional and advanced statistics in earnest in the 1970s, with the establishment of the Society for American Baseball Research (<a href=\"https://sabr.org/about/founders\" target=\"_blank\">SABR</a>) in 1971 and <a href=\"https://baseball.fandom.com/wiki/Bill_James\" target=\"_blank\">Bill James</a>'s first publication of The Bill James Baseball Abstracts in 1977. The growth of Major League Baseball's use of statistical accelerated even more with the success of the Oakland Athletics in the early 2000s, who used player data to help them adhere to the <a href=\"https://grantland.com/features/the-economics-moneyball/\" target=\"_blank\">Moneyball</a> philosophy.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a similar time of the exponential increase of statistical use in MLB, fantasy sports, including fantasy baseball, has grown in its popularity. In fantasy baseball, any number of people can form a fantasy league together, with a commissioner to oversee the league operations. Each member of the league, including the commissioner, assumes control of their own team and attempts to select, through a league draft, as many of the best players in baseball as possible. In fantasy baseball, \"best\" or \"good\" players can be determined in any number of ways, with the most common being through the points system. In the points system, players can earn a fantasy team points through positive individual actions in a game, such as getting a hit or scoring a run, and can lose points through negative individual actions in a game, such as a batter striking out or a pitcher giving up a hit. Throughout the season, a team must accumulate as many points as possible. This can be achieved by trading players with other league members (team owners) or by adding a player from the league free agent pool and dropping a player currently on the team, giving each owner as close to a feel of running a real life team as possible. At the end of the season, one team and its owner is crowned the fantasy league champion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many fantasy baseball leagues are single-season leagues, meaning every year the team owners select new teams from all of the players playing in MLB, with some players from the <a href=\"https://www.milb.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">minors</a>, being available in a draft. However, an increasing trend in fantasy sports is the concept of dynasty leagues, which provide an even closer feel of controlling a real-life team. A dynasty baseball league is long-term, meaning that there is an initial draft at the inception of the league and at the end of a season, each owner selects a certain number of players on their team they want to keep for the following season. There is then a draft of the remaining players in the player pool and teams can even trade current and future draft picks, just like teams do in professional sports. Fantasy baseball is perfect for anyone interested in baseball and statistics, as it relies on statistics to determine the point values of players, which helps determine the strongest fantasy league team at the end of the season. The points settings used to calculate the number of points produced by a player is listed under the section \"Points System\".\n",
    "\n",
    "As someone interested in statistics and a fan of the Baltimore Orioles, I have recently joined a 14-member dynasty baseball league with my twin brother and both of our friends. This league, called We Are Sabermetrics, runs on the <a href=\"https://www.fantrax.com\" target=\"_blank\">Fantrax</a> website and relies on the aforementioned points system to determine the \"fantasy value\" of players. Throughout the season, teams compete in weekly matchups where the team who scores the most points in the matchups wins. At the end of the season, the top 4 teams compete in the playoffs for the league championship. Although my team made the playoffs for the shortened 2020 MLB season, much can be done to improve the team, as it struggled to score points at times throughout the season. This tutorial will provide valuable insight not just for my improvement of a team, but for anybody looking to build a dominant fantasy baseball team. It will look at traditional statistics such as Home Runs and Earned Run Average (ERA) as well as more advanced statistics such as Runs Created and Fielding Independent Pitching. Through an analysis of 10 years of data for both batters and pitchers, the tutorial will attempt to use statistics of a player's performance in previous seasons to predict the performance for the following season, which would then help determine the baseball players most likely to produce the most points for a fantasy team owner. At the end of the tutorial, you should have a better understanding of how to predict a player's future performance and hopefully a desire to join your own fantasy baseball league, if you are currently not in a league."
